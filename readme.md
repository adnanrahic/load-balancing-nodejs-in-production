# Load-Balancing Node.js in Production

This repo contains 4 ways of load balancing Node.js for production environments. I compiled these instructions and setups as put them in one place in preparation for a talk I did at WebCampZagreb2019.

You can check out [the talk here](https://2019.webcampzg.org/talks/load-balancing-nodejs-in-production/).

Load balancing techniques:

- Node.js `cluster` module.
- Nginx + Node.js as a system process.
- Docker Swarm
- Kubernetes
